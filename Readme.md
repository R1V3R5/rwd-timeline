1. Using the breakpoint images below, create the the website using HTML and CSS.
2. Make sure the site is FULLY responsive. Even though there are only 3 images listed below, you'll need to make sure that everything in between is fluid.
3. I'm not concerned with the icons, colors or text matching. Use Font Awesome and pick the icons, and feel free to use Meet the Ipsums for your text.
    * However, the layout, sizing, borders, radii, etc should all match.
